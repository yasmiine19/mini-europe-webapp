## 📖 About the Project  

Before this app, Mini-Europe staff collected visitor origins on **paper surveys**, which were later processed manually.  
This was slow, error-prone, and gave little insight during the day.  

With the new **digital webapp**:  
- ✅ Staff can log visitors in just **one tap** on a tablet  
- ✅ Data is stored in **real time** in Firebase  
- ✅ The marketing team can immediately see **statistics per country & per hour**  
- ✅ At the end of the day, a **full Excel export** is available  

👉 This solution reduced paperwork, saved time, and improved the accuracy of visitor statistics.
